1. Breadth First Search has been used in Communities Detection (task4)
2. I have a seperate class for Node data structure. For this reason, so I have generated a runnable jar from eclipse. Could you please execute the command in
the following format?
java -jar search.jar -t 4 -i "/mnt/shared-windows/examples/examples/1/input1.txt" -t "/mnt/shared-windows/examples/examples/1/tiebreaking1.txt" -op output1_path_bfs.txt -ol output1_tlog_bfs.txt
